    //jdk stands for java development kit.It is a software used to develop the applications.
    //jre stands for java runtime environment.It is a software package which provides jvm,libraries which is used to run application in java.
    //jvm is a software engine which runs java bytecode.jdk and jre is platform dependent while jvm is platform independent.
    //jvm allocates two types of memory areas-1.heap 2.stack
    //in heap memory jvm stores objects & in stack memory it stores variables.
    //the JIT compiler helps improve the performance of Java programs by compiling bytecodes into native machine code at run time or it optimizes the program.
    //the Java compiler does not generate machine code for a hardware-specific instruction set. Instead, the Java compiler converts Java source code into Java virtual machine instructions, which Java class files store.
    //The Java platform is different from other programming platforms because it is platform-independent and runs on the principle of “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA). Unlike traditional platforms that are hardware or operating system dependent, Java uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute programs.

//Key Differences:

//Platform Independence

//Other platforms (like C, C++) compile programs into machine code specific to an operating system.

//Java compiles code into bytecode, which can run on any machine having a JVM.

//Execution

//Other platforms run code directly on the OS.

//Java runs inside the JVM, which provides a virtual execution environment.

//Security

//Java provides a secure sandbox environment for running programs.

//Other platforms do not have such built-in security layers.

//Memory Management

//Java has automatic garbage collection.

//Other platforms often require manual memory management.


//The Java class loader, part of the Java Runtime Environment, dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine. Usually classes are only loaded on demand. The virtual machine will only load the class files required for executing the program.

//In Java, main is not a keyword but an identifier—a name assigned to the method that serves as the entry point for program execution. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) specifically looks for a method named main with the correct signature to start execution.
